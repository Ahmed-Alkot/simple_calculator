# simple calculator
CSCI 101: Introduction to programming course project. A simple arithmetic calculator with extra features like evaluating integrals, derivatives, 
------------------------------------------------

This project utalizes WolframAlpha's computational knowledge engine.

upon opening the app, you are met with the usual user-inteface of calulators where you can do arithmetic.

on the top right corner there is a menu button where you can access the API-based integral and derivative calculator.

------------------------------------------------

to use it, just write down your query in the entry box preceded by the operation you desire, "integrate" to get undifinite integrals

or "intgerate f(x)dx from a to b" to get the definite integral of f(x) from a to b. Use the keyword "differentiate" to get the derivative of a single or multiple variable function. 

there are two different outputs: a plaintext output which will be printed right below the entry box. as well as an image of the full solution written in LaTeX.
