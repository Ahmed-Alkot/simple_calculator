# simple_calculator
this res is for my first school project. it is a normal arithmetic calculator with extra features like evaluating integrals, derivatives, 
------------------------------------------------

this is a calculator that utalizes WolframAlpha's powerful computational knowledge engine.

upon opening the app, you are met with the usual user-inteface for calculators where you can do all the arethmatics you want

on the top right corner you will see a menu button where you can access the API-based integral and derivative calculator

------------------------------------------------

to use it, just write down your query in the entry box preceded by the operation you desire, "integrate" to get undifinite integrals

or "intgerate f(x)dx from a to b" to get the definite integral of f(x) from a to b. and you can also choose to "derivate" where you will get the derivative of the function inputted. 

there are two different outputs: a plaintext output which will be printed right below the entry box. as well as an image of the full solution written in LaTeX.
